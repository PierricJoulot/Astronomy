# Astronomy

This repo is where I am going to add everything I do at/for Geneva's Observatory, in the domaine of exoplanets.

In this repo, I'll add:
 -  My learning of the lightkurve package ([tutorials](http://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/index.html))
 -  Study of  a few lightcurves () for the search of exoplanets, star's variations, supernovae, binaries, etc.
 
 This experiment was made possible by [Helen Giles](https://www.helengiles.com/) and [Oliver Turner](http://nccr-planets.ch/team/turner-oliver-dr/)
