# Astronomy

This repo is where I am going to add everything I do at/for Geneva's Observatory, in the domaine of exoplanets.

In this repo, I'll add:
 -  My learning of the lightkurve package ([tutorials](http://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/index.html))
 -  Study of  a few lightcurves (EPIC228735255, EPIC249624646, EPIC248914080, EPIC247418783, EPIC249470337, EPIC210363145, EPIC211813818, EPIC212417656, EPIC249346402, EPIC201885041, EPIC201437844, EPIC246067459, EPIC248847494, EPIC248029954, EPIC248660220) for the search of exoplanets, star's variations, supernovae, binaries, etc.
 
 This experiment was made possible by [Helen Giles](https://www.helengiles.com/) and [Oliver Turner](http://nccr-planets.ch/team/turner-oliver-dr/)
