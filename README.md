# Astronomy

This repo is where I am going to add everything I do at/for Geneva's Observatory, in the domaine of exoplanets.

In this repo, I'll add:

 -  My learning of the lightkurve package ([tutorials](http://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/index.html))
 -  Study of a few lightcurves: (✓="completed", ...="currently working on it", X="untouched")
