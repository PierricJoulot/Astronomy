# Astronomy

This repo is where I am going to add everything I do at/for Geneva's Observatory, in the domaine of exoplanets.

In this repo, I'll add:
 -  My learning of the lightkurve package (tutorials)
 -  Studies of lightcurves for known binary stars, exoplanets, pulsing stars, etc
 -  A deeper study of one lightcurve
 
 This experiment was made possible by [Helen Giles](https://www.helengiles.com/) and [Oliver Turner](http://nccr-planets.ch/team/turner-oliver-dr/)
